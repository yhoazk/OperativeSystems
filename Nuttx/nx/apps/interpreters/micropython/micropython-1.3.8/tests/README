This directory contains tests for various functionality areas of MicroPython.
To run all stable tests, run "run-tests" script in this directory. Note
that bytecode tests are not yet stable and should be run separately in
"bytecode" subdirectory.

When creating new tests, anything that relies on float support should go in the 
float/ subdirectory.  Anything that relies on import x, where x is not a built-in
module, should go in the import/ subdirectory.
